Hi

You need to structure your project right:

EG:

source folder
   -resources folder
       -css folder
	   -images folder
       -mail folder
	your pages
	
upload the files in git cause it wont work on local

hi 

if it doesnt work after i did that i'll just re do it fom scratch 
i'll delete all the folders that i have and redo it again

Why do you have to use git for hosting the git? Git is for storing the code. Thats why it does not work.
You need to upload it to a domain. Free domain. 

the instructions said we need to use git , what do you think? or what can you recommend?

its my frst time doing this ,i learned nertworks so i would'nt say i know what i'm doing . i've only started this 2 weeks ago

Okay if the instructions says that upload it to git. But you can show them on your local machine that it runs

Clean the files I did resources folder for you. I need to sleep now. 

Give me 10 minutes will clean your code


Done you can upload the code to git. it wont work on local machine for sending email. It must run on the internet.
